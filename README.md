Python &amp; Pandas &amp; SQLite

As requested by Professor, now the application saves the data on the SQLite database. 

In the first post ([here][1]) we did a python program to join three spreadsheets in just one. This work involves knowledge of pandas to organize the data.  

Now we create a database and a table to store all data.  This version is so simple and does not check the user store option. 

I'll create a new project on GitHub because I'll show how to merge these steps in one project. (god to understand git commands line)
